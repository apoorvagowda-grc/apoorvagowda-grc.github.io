            <h2>What Happened to the Cast of Lizzie McGuire?</h2>
            <p>We grew up watching Lizzie, Gordo, and Miranda navigate middle school drama, digital cameras, and butterfly clips. They were relatable, awkward, and had some of the best one-liners of 2000s Disney Channel. But where are the actors now—and did they ever reunite IRL? Let’s find out who’s still in the spotlight and who left Hollywood behind.</p>
            <h3>Hilary Duff (Lizzie)</h3>
            <p>Hilary Duff blossomed into a full-blown millennial icon. After <em>Lizzie</em>, she starred in movies like <em>A Cinderella Story</em> and <em>Raise Your Voice</em>, released hit pop albums (hello, “Come Clean”), and eventually found her footing in grown-up TV with <em>Younger</em> and <em>How I Met Your Father</em>. She’s now a mom of three, an entrepreneur, and still the queen of our hearts.</p>

            <h3>Adam Lamberg (Gordo)</h3>
            <p>Adam Lamberg, aka the sweet and loyal Gordo, stepped away from the spotlight after the show. He studied at NYU and now works behind the scenes in the arts, reportedly with the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation. He was even spotted on the set of the <em>Lizzie McGuire</em> reboot before it was sadly canceled.</p>

            <h3>Lalaine (Miranda)</h3>
            <p>Lalaine, who played Miranda, mysteriously vanished halfway through the show (remember when she "went to Mexico" and never came back?). IRL, she explored music and acting, then took a step back from the spotlight. She’s now re-emerging online and reclaiming her space as a Filipina-American Y2K icon.</p>

               <figcaption>Post-Lizzie, Lalaine leaned into music and left the spotlight—but fans never forgot.</figcaption>

            <h3>Jake Thomas (Matt)</h3>
            <p>Jake Thomas, aka prankster little bro Matt McGuire, stuck with acting and branched into photography and filmmaking. He’s had roles in <em>NCIS</em>, <em>Criminal Minds</em>, and more, and now creates behind the camera.</p>

            <h3>Hallie Todd (Jo McGuire)</h3>
            <p>Hallie Todd, Lizzie’s on-screen mom, is still in the storytelling world. She’s acted in indie films, co-written screenplays, and mentors aspiring writers. Basically, she's still being a total TV mom, just off-screen.</p>
